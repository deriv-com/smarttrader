   ```

7. **To start developing:**

   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```

8. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at [https://localhost](https://localhost)

## Preview on your local machine

- To preview your changes locally, run `npm run serve`
   - It will watch for Javascript or CSS changes and will rebuild on every change you make.
- Go to [https://localhost/en/endpoint.html](https://localhost/en/endpoint.html) and change App ID and Server
- Login with test account

- To test changes made to templates, you need to re-compile them:
  - `grunt shell:compile_dev` to re-compile all templates.
  - `grunt shell:compile_dev --path=about-us` to re-compile only template(s) which serve about-us path in URL.
- To fix eslint errors run `npm run eslint`

## Test link deployment
### Deploy your changes on Vercel (Recommended Option)

1. Commit, push your changes, and create a pull request. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy your application and generate a test link.

2.  Register your application [here](https://api.deriv.com/dashboard/). This will give you the ability to redirect back to your deployed page after login.
    Use `<GENERATED_TEST_LINK_URL>/en/logged_inws.html` for the Redirect URL and `<GENERATED_TEST_LINK_URL>/en/redirect.html` for the Verification URL.
    - Have your API token ready from app.deriv.com account in order to register
    - Make note of your App ID to use at `<GENERATED_TEST_LINK_URL>/en/endpoint.html`

Alternatively, you can manually deploy your test link using gh-pages with the following configurations:

### Deploy to your gh-pages for the first time (Alternate Option)

1.  Register your application [here](https://api.deriv.com/dashboard/). This will give you the ability to redirect back to your Github pages after login.
    Use `https://YOUR_GITHUB_NAME.github.io/smarttrader/en/logged_inws.html` for the Redirect URL and `https://YOUR_GITHUB_NAME.github.io/smarttrader/en/redirect.html` for the Verification URL.

        If you're using a custom domain, replace the Github URLs above with your domain.

2.  In `src/javascript/config.js`: Insert the `Application ID` of your registered application in `user_app_id`.

- **NOTE:** In order to avoid accidentally committing personal changes to this file, use `git update-index --assume-unchanged src/javascript/config.js`

3. Run `grunt dev`

### Deploy js/css and template changes together

```sh
grunt dev
```

### Deploy only js/css changes

```sh
grunt deploy
```

### Deploy some template changes

```sh
grunt dev --path=about-us
```

### Using sub-folders

There are times that you are working on various branches at the same time, and you want to deploy/test each branch separately on your gh-pages, you can simply use `--branch=branchname` for grunt commands:

- `grunt dev --branch=branchname`
  This will deploy your changes to a sub-folder named: `br_branchname` and it can be browsed at: https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/smarttrader/br_branchname/

In order to remove the created folders from your gh-pages, you can use either:

- `grunt dev --cleanup`: removes all `br_*` folders and deploys to the root folder.

  or

- `grunt shell:remove_folder --folder=br_branchname1,br_branchname2,...`: only removes the specified folder(s) from your gh-pages.

  or

- `grunt shell:remove_folder --keep --folder=br_branchname1,br_branchname2,...`: only keeps the specified folder(s) on your gh-pages and removes everything else. Just add the `--keep` flag.

### Use a custom domain

In order to use your custom domain, please put it in a file named `CNAME` inside `scripts` folder of your local clone of the smarttrader repo.

## Manage releases

```sh
git tag ${RELEASE_TARGET}_vYYYYMMDD_${INTEGER} -m 'some message'
```

> `RELEASE_TARGET` could be one of **staging** or **production** for staging and production release respectively.

Example:

```sh
git tag production_v20191010_0 -m 'release fixes to production'
```

Push the tag:

```sh
git push origin staging_v20191010_0
```

## Manage translations

To add translation manually use [manual translation doc](scripts/README.md#Updating-the-translations)

## Disaster Recovery

Each release, whether to staging or production is backed up and deployed to Vercel

You may see the current production and staging deployed into: https://staging-smarttrader-dr.binary.sx and https://smarttrader-dr.binary.sx
