The calculation will include a bias in favour of the Company. The financial contract prices (or the payout amounts) offered to clients speculating on market or index prices may substantially differ from prices available in the primary markets where commodities or contracts thereupon are traded, due to the bias favouring the Company in the price calculation system referred to above.</p><p>The charting data made available to clients by the Company is indicative only and may at times differ from the real market values. The Company&#x27;s decision as to the calculation of a financial contract price will be final and binding.

BIEL is not authorised to and does not offer investment, financial, legal, tax, regulatory, and/or other types of advice or state an opinion in relation to a Transaction under any circumstances. Clients should get independent advice from an investment adviser if they have any doubts about dealing in financial products.</p><p>From time to time, BIEL may decide to provide the client with written or video information, which BIEL may publish on its website or provide to the client in any other manner.

Such clients&#x27; money bank accounts may be opened with EEA Institutions or Institutions outside the EEA. Where clients&#x27; money is held with non-EEA Institutions, this means that such accounts will be subject to laws other than those of an EEA member state and clients&#x27; rights may differ accordingly.</p><p>The Financial Products that BIEL offers to deal in are contracts entered into between clients and BIEL. Under these contracts and subject to the specific terms of the relevant contract, in consideration for the premium or price that clients pay BIEL, BIEL promises to pay clients a certain amount if the reference assets or measurements perform in a particular manner. These contracts accordingly are not instruments that BIEL holds on clients&#x27; behalf and neither benefits from clients&#x27; assets protection in the event of BIEL&#x27;s insolvency. Similarly, the premium or price that clients pay to take out a trade is not held as clients&#x27; money but as consideration for BIEL&#x27;s undertaking to pay.</p><p>The client acknowledges and agrees to the following:<ul class="bullet"><li>The Company will not pay interest on the client money.</li><li>Where the client&#x27;s obligations to the Company are due and payable, the Company shall cease to treat as client money the amount equal to the amount of such obligations.</li><li>The Company may use the client money for the purposes of meeting obligations that are incurred by the Company in connection with the margining, guaranteeing, securing, transferring, adjusting, or settling of the client&#x27;s dealings in derivatives.</li></ul></p><h2 data-anchor="investor-compensation-scheme">Système d&#x27;indemnisation des investisseurs</h2><p>BIEL forms part of <a href="http://www.compensationschemes.org.mt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Investor Compensation Scheme</a> (the &quot;Scheme&quot;), which is a rescue fund for investors that are clients of failed investment firms licensed by the MFSA.

If a client&#x27;s Margin Level is less than the Margin Level set for their account, the client has entered into a Margin Call and is required to increase their Margin Level above the account&#x27;s specified level in order to avoid a Stop Out to occur. The client may not be able to place an Order to open a Transaction unless there is sufficient Account Equity to cover the Total Margin.</li><li>The client acknowledges that it is their responsibility to monitor their Account Balance and Margin Requirement, and the Company is not under any obligation to keep the client informed (i.e. to make a Margin Call).</li></ol></li><li>Margin Requirement and calculation<p><ol><li>Margin Requirement is the amount that the client needs to have in their account prior to entering into a trade and it is a percentage of the value of that trade.

If the client chooses to trade FX and CFDs, the client shall transfer funds from their Binary.com account to their MT5 Real Account. Such a transfer shall not be regarded as a transfer from two different accounts but as a transfer of funds from the client&#x27;s centralised Binary.com account to the MT5 Real Account. No fund transfers shall be made to any other account in the name of any third party.</p><p>The client agrees to comply with the following when making payments to BIEL:</p><ol><li>Deposits and/or payments due are to be made in the currency chosen by the client from the ones specified by BIEL from time to time.</li><li>The client is responsible for all third-party electronic transfer fees in respect of payments.</li><li>Payments made to BIEL will only be deemed to have been received once BIEL receives cleared funds.</li><li>The client bears the responsibility of ensuring that payments made to BIEL are correctly received with the specified client&#x27;s account details.</li></ol><p>There are no charges for transferring money from the client&#x27;s Binary.com account to their MT5 Real Account.</p></li><li>Transfer of funds from the MT5 Real Account<p>If the client has a positive balance in their MT5 Real Account, they may transfer such balance from their MT5 Real Account into their Binary.com account and then request a withdrawal as necessary for any amount available on their Binary.com account. The Company may withhold, deduct, or refuse to make any such transfer or withdrawal, in whole or in part, if</p><ol><li>The client has Open Positions on the account that show a loss.</li><li>Such a transfer would result in the client&#x27;s Account Equity dropping to less than zero.</li><li>The requested transfer would reduce the client&#x27;s Account Balance to less than the Margin required for the client&#x27;s Open Positions.</li><li>The Company reasonably considers that funds may be required to meet any current or future Margin Requirements on Open Positions due to the underlying market conditions.</li><li>The Company reasonably determines that there is an unresolved dispute between the Company and the client relating to the agreed terms and conditions.</li><li>There is an amount outstanding from the client to BIEL.</li><li>BIEL is required to do so in accordance with any relevant law or regulation.</li></ol><p>The client&#x27;s MT5 Real Account as well as all payments and withdrawals therefrom must be made in the same currency as maintained in the client&#x27;s Binary.com account.</p></li><li>Protection de Solde Négatif<p>When using the MT5 trading platform, all BIEL&#x27;s clients will be provided with Margin monitoring functionality to protect the clients from encountering negative balances when trading under normal market conditions. As a trader, the client should always maintain the appropriate levels of Margin in their trading account as the recommended method of their own risk management.</p><p>If the client&#x27;s usable Margin drops below 100%, a Margin Call mode will be triggered and maintained till the level of 50%. In the event that the client&#x27;s Margin Level is equal to, or drops below 50%, the Company will initiate the closing of the client&#x27;s current Open Positions, starting from the most unprofitable, until the required Margin Level is achieved. In such events, the positions will be automatically closed at the current market price at that point in time.</p><p>In exceptional circumstances, where there is a price change in the underlying that is sufficiently large and sudden, gapping can occur. In such cases, the automatic Margin close-out protection might fail, causing the client&#x27;s Account Balance to fall below zero. For this purpose, a Negative Balance Protection mechanism has been introduced. Negative Balance Protection provides a &#x27;backstop&#x27; in case of extreme market conditions and ensures that the client&#x27;s maximum losses from trading CFDs, including all related costs, are limited to the balance available on the client&#x27;s CFD account. Therefore, the client can never lose more money than the total sum invested for trading CFDs; if the client&#x27;s CFD account balance falls below zero, the Company will compensate the negative balance as soon as possible without any additional cost to the client.</p><p>Negative Balance Protection does not apply to the clients categorised as Professional Traders, who can still lose more money than their available balance.</p><p>The Company does not offer credit to its clients. The client acknowledges and agrees that they will not be dealing with the Company on credit.</p></li></ol></li><li><strong>Account closure</strong><p>If the client wishes to withdraw funds from their MT5 Real Account and/or close their MT5 Real Account, the client may notify the Company by contacting the helpdesk at <a href="mailto:support@binary.com">support@binary.com</a>.

Reasons for differences in feed providers include:</p><ul><li>For forex: The forex market is an OTC (over the counter) market, where banks and other major financial institutions trade currencies amongst themselves without there being any central clearing house. Accordingly, there is no &#x27;official&#x27; price source for forex quotes. Different data feeds will contain quotes from a different sub-set of international banks. Accordingly, prices may differ among providers, depending on which bank(s) they obtain prices from.</li><li>Market-closing times: The client is asked to refer to <a href="/fr/resources/market_timesws.html">Trading times</a> page for the exact time of settlement for all contracts. Other websites may adopt a different convention (for example, some websites choose 4 o&#x27;clock NY time or 5 o&#x27;clock London time). As a result, the open, high, low, and closing prices displayed on the Company&#x27;s website may differ from those on other websites, due to the market-closing time convention.</li><li>Use of bid/ask prices: When the market is illiquid, the data feed may contain many bid and ask prices, without there actually being any traded price for quite a while. By taking an average of the bid/ask price (i.e. bid + ask, divided by 2), a market quote is generated that reflects the current market, without it actually being a traded price. The Company&#x27;s system will generate prices from these bid and ask prices, whereas other websites might not. As a result, the Company&#x27;s website might display ticks that do not appear in the data feeds of other websites.</li></ul><p>The Company&#x27;s data feed is designed to be one of the best and most robust available for a trading environment.</p><h2 data-anchor="weekend-quotes">Cotations du weekend</h2><p>The client is asked to note that weekend quotes are ignored for the purpose of contract settlement. During weekends, the forex markets may occasionally generate prices; however, these prices are often artificial (traders sometimes take advantage of the illiquidity of the markets during weekends to push prices up or down). To avoid settling prices based on such artificial prices, it is Company&#x27;s policy not to count weekend prices towards contract settlement values (except for Volatility Indices, which are open during weekends).</p></div></div><div id="privacy-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="security-and-privacy">Sécurité et confidentialité</h2><p>The Company recognises the importance of protecting the client&#x27;s personal and financial information.</p><p>All the information that the Company obtains about the client assists the Company in servicing the client and the client&#x27;s account. The Company knows that the client may be concerned about what the Company does with this information.</p><p>The Company has outlined the Company&#x27;s privacy practices for the client as follows:</p><h2 data-anchor="use-of-information">Use of information</h2><p>The Company operates in full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable Data Protection laws. These regulatory measures place obligations on users of personal data like the Company. They also lay down the principles for fair and lawful processing of all the information that the Company acquires.</p><p>It is the Company&#x27;s commitment to safeguard the client&#x27;s privacy online at all times. The Company only uses the client&#x27;s personal information to help the Company service the client&#x27;s account, to improve the Company&#x27;s services to the client, and to provide the client with products that the client has requested. The Company does not sell the client&#x27;s personal information to third parties, but the Company may provide it to payment providers to facilitate transactions on the client&#x27;s account.</p><p>The client&#x27;s personal information is used primarily as a way of validating the client as the legitimate account owner and proper recipient of withdrawal payments. The Company also uses this information to process the client&#x27;s trades. The Company collects from the client all personal and financial data directly relating to the client when the client fills in the Company&#x27;s account opening form. In all instances, the client has either a legal or a contractual obligation to provide the Company with the information. If such information is not provided, the Company will be unable to provide the client with its services.</p><p>The Company reserves the right to request further information from the client whenever deemed appropriate under the circumstances. For example, the Company may ask the client to send the Company additional acceptable documents to confirm the authenticity of the client&#x27;s account details or of any withdrawal request.</p><p>The Company holds all the personal data that the Company collects from the client with due diligence and only processes them for purposes as required or allowed by law. This includes the process of obtaining and sharing of certain information with third parties for credit or identity checks to comply with legal and regulatory obligations. In certain cases, the Company may process the client&#x27;s data to fulfill the Company&#x27;s contractual obligations with the client.</p><p>The Company also collects basic tax residence information for the purposes of CRS/FATCA compliance. The tax information that the client provides may only be disclosed to the authorities who are legally charged with collecting this information for CRS/FATCA reporting, and Binary.com will only do so to the extent that is legally obliged to collect it from the clients and disclose it to the authorities. The Company does not use, disclose, or process this information in any other way at any time.</p><p>The client may update the client&#x27;s personal information at any time by logging in to the &quot;Settings&quot; section of the client&#x27;s account. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to ensure that Binary.com is promptly and continually informed of any change in the client&#x27;s personal information. The client should note that if the client provides the Company with inaccurate information, or if the client fails to notify the Company of any changes to the information previously supplied by the client, this may adversely affect the quality of the services that the Company can provide.</p><h2 data-anchor="profiling-and-categorisation">Profiling and categorisation</h2><p>The Company collects and assesses the client&#x27;s data to profile the client in relation to the Company&#x27;s products.

This includes any of the Company&#x27;s business associates or payment providers within or outside of the EEA, including countries that might not offer an equivalent level of protection of personal data. In all instances, the Company places a contractual obligation on such third parties to offer the same level of rights and protection as stipulated in the GDPR.</p><p>The client also has the right to request copies of any personal information that the client has provided to the Company and to request that the Company transmit such information to other service providers.</p><h2 data-anchor="consent">Consentement</h2><p>When the client opens an account with the Company, the Company will request the client&#x27;s consent for the distribution of marketing materials to the e-mail address that the client provides to the Company upon sign-up.</p><h2 data-anchor="right-of-object">Right to object</h2><p>The client has the right to object to the direct distribution of marketing materials. This can be done by either not providing the client&#x27;s consent to any marketing material before the service is rendered or revoking it at any point during the service. In both cases, the Company will refrain from distributing marketing materials to the client.</p><h2 data-anchor="access-to-personal-data">Access to personal data</h2><p>Access to the client&#x27;s personal data is strictly prohibited, with the exception of key Binary.com personnel and only as needed for the performance of their duties.</p><p>If Binary.com is legally required to disclose the client&#x27;s personal or financial information by law, regulation, or pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction or a governmental agency, the Company will promptly notify the client, as it deems appropriate, to give the client the opportunity to seek protection for the information. The Company will do so unless legally prohibited. Such required disclosure shall not be interpreted as a breach of this terms and conditions agreement.</p><p>The client also has the right to request that the Company copy, modify, or remove the client&#x27;s personal information as long as such actions do not breach any legal or regulatory obligations that the Company may have.</p></div><h2 data-anchor="data-retention">Conservation des données</h2><p>If the client chooses to close the client&#x27;s Binary.com account, the client&#x27;s data will be kept only until the Company&#x27;s legal and regulatory obligations on data retention are met. The Company will delete the client&#x27;s data once the applicable retention period expires.</p><h2 data-anchor="security-statement">Security statement</h2><p>Taking the following measures, the Company is committed to making sure that the client&#x27;s personal data and transactions are secure:</p><ol><li>The client&#x27;s password and login ID are unique, and passwords are hashed so that not even Binary.com staff can read them. This is the reason why the Company cannot retrieve the client&#x27;s password and has to issue the client with a new one, sent to the client&#x27;s email address, if the client cannot recall it.</li><li>The Company maintains customer balances in cash or cash equivalent. The Company ensures that 100% of each customer&#x27;s balance is available for immediate withdrawal, subject to verification.</li><li>Toutes les informations relatives aux cartes bancaires sont directement transmises au réseau Visa/MasterCard par le biais de la dernière technologie de cryptage SSL, conformément aux politiques des banques.</li><li>The Company&#x27;s information security policies are based on industry best practices in access control and business continuity.</li><li>The Company uses identity verification services and real-time fraud detection measures to help protect the client from unauthorised access to the client&#x27;s account. The Company also monitors account activity for signs of unusual activity that might indicate fraud and work with collection and law-enforcement agencies to address fraud issues.</li><li>The client is responsible for keeping the client&#x27;s log-in details secure, the security of any linked email address, and the security (password protection, screen locking, etc) of any personal computer or device on which the client&#x27;s account is accessible.

The Company also maintains procedures to manage actual or potential conflicts. This includes procedures to maintain appropriate independence among members of the Company&#x27;s staff who are involved in potentially conflicting activities. Such independence-upholding procedures can be followed, for example, through the operation of information barriers, physical separation of staff, the segregation of duties and responsibilities, and the maintenance of a policy of independence, which requires the Company&#x27;s staff, when providing services to a client, to act in the best interests of the client and to disregard any conflicts of interest, or in some circumstances, to decline to act for a client or potential client in order to avoid conflicts of interest.</p><h2 data-anchor="disclosure-general">Disclosure (General)</h2><p>The organisational and administrative arrangements established by the Company to prevent or manage a conflict are not sufficient to ensure, with reasonable confidence, that the risk of damage to the interest of the client will be prevented.

Any decision to open an account and to use the Company&#x27;s products or services is the client&#x27;s.

The Company does not monitor on the client&#x27;s behalf whether the amount of money that the client has sent to the Company or the client&#x27;s profits or losses are consistent with that information.

Neither professional clients nor eligible counterparties can benefit from this protection.</p></div><h2 data-anchor="contract-risks">Contract risks</h2><p>The client should not trade or invest in Binary Options unless the client knows and understands the products&#x27; risks involved and that the client may lose all the money invested.</p><p>&quot;Binary&quot; or &quot;digital&quot; options are options that pay a pre-determined, fixed amount, depending on whether or not an event occurs at the time the Binary Option expires. Binary Options can have only one of two possible outcomes and allow the client to take a simple &quot;Yes or No&quot; approach. Like traditional options, Binary Options are based on an underlying asset such as currencies, commodities, or indices; however, one of the most significant differences between Binary Options and traditional options, among others, is that there can only be two outcomes for the option, either the client is paid the return upon the occurrence of the event, or the client loses the investment amount as determined in each option.</p><p>Trading in Binary Options is speculative and involves a high degree of risk that can result in the loss of the client&#x27;s entire investment. Therefore, trading in Binary Options is appropriate only for persons that understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal, and other risks involved in such transactions. The client should be satisfied that Binary Options trading is suitable for the client in light of the client&#x27;s investment circumstances and attitude towards risk before trading. The client should not engage in speculative Binary Options trading unless the client understands the basic aspects of such trading and its risks. If the client is in any doubt as to whether Binary Option trading is appropriate and suitable for the client, the client should seek independent advice from an investment consulting professional. Binary.com does not provide such advice. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility, taking into account the client&#x27;s personal circumstances and investment resources, to take particular care and make careful considerations independently, both prior to applying to engage in Binary Options with Binary.com and prior to making any individual order. Where the client does not understand the risks involved in applying for a trading account with Binary.com or in making any individual order, the client should seek advice and consultation from an independent investment advisor. If the client continues to not understand the risks involved in trading in Binary Options, the client should not trade at all.</p><p>The client is advised that the Binary Options offered by Binary.com are not traded under the rules of any recognised, designated, or regulated exchange. Consequently, engaging in Binary Options trading may expose the client to substantially greater risks than the investments that are so traded.</p><p>The client is warned of the following additional risks:</p><p>Derivative investment instruments such as Binary Options and related markets can be highly volatile. The prices of the underlying instrument that a Binary Option refers to may fluctuate rapidly and over wide ranges and may reflect unforeseeable events or changes in conditions, none of which can be controlled by the client or Binary.com.</p><p>Binary.com tries to maintain a reasonable relation between the quoted prices of each underlying asset that a Binary Option refers to and the actual market prices of such an asset. Binary.com makes no warranty, expressed or implied, that the quoted prices represent prevailing market prices.</p><p>Binary.com may have access to information that is not available to the client, may have acquired trading positions at prices that are not available to the client, and may have interests different from the client&#x27;s interests. Binary.com does not undertake any obligation to provide the client with market or other information that the Company possesses, nor to alter or refrain from the Company&#x27;s own trading.</p><p>Information de la performance précédente de n&#x27;importe quel instrument ou actif sous-jacent ne garantit pas sa performance actuelle et/ou future. Une performance du passé n&#x27;est pas un indicateur fiable des résultats futurs.</p><h2 data-anchor="risks-of-investment-products">Risques liés aux poduits d&#x27;investissement</h2><p>Investing or trading in contracts exposes the client to the performance of the underlying or reference instrument or asset to which the Binary contract refers, including foreign exchange, indices, and commodities, each of which have their own features and risks.</p><p>Exchange Rate Risk: Exchange rates between foreign currencies can change rapidly due to a wide range of economic, political, and other conditions, exposing the client to the risk of exchange rate losses in addition to the inherent risk of loss from trading the underlying Investment Product. If the client deposits funds in a currency to trade contracts denominated in a different currency, the client&#x27;s gains or losses on the underlying investment may be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the currencies.</p><p>Other Risks: There are other risks related to trading Investment Products and foreign currencies that cannot be described in detail in this document. Generally, however, securities, options, and currency transactions involve exposure to a combination of the following risk factors: market risk, credit risk, settlement risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. For example, there can be serious market disruptions if local or overseas economic, political, or other unforeseen events affect the market. In addition to these types of risk, there may be other factors such as accounting and tax treatment issues that the client should consider.</p><h2 data-anchor="market-opinions">Market opinions</h2><p>All opinions, news, research, analysis, prices, or other information contained on this website are provided as general market commentary and do not constitute investment advice.

The client should be aware of all costs and charges that apply to the client because they will affect the client&#x27;s profitability.</p></div></div><div id="risk-mt-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="risk-disclosure-statement">Risk disclosure statement</h2><p>This risk disclosure statement is not exhaustive and is not intended to constitute a comprehensive statement of all the risks to which the client might be exposed and does not describe all the risks inherent to forex and contracts for differences that exist now or which may arise in the future. Its objective is rather to provide the client with information, so that the client can reasonably understand the risks associated with forex and contracts for differences offered by Binary.com, as it is the Company&#x27;s intention to provide the client with the best possible trading experience.</p><h2 data-anchor="forex-and-cfd-high-risk">Le Forex et les contracts pour différences sont à hauts risques et spéculatifs</h2><p>Forex and contract for differences transactions involve a high degree of risk and are speculative because they allow the client to speculate on the short-term price movements of the underlying financial instruments. The client should not enter into forex and/or contract-for-difference transactions unless the client is able to sustain losses that exceed the client&#x27;s deposited funds. It is important for the client to understand that in order to realise any value from the client&#x27;s open positions, the client would have to enter into a corresponding transaction to close the client&#x27;s open positions and may find it difficult or impossible to do so under certain market conditions.</p><h2 data-anchor="execution-model">Modèle d&#x27;execution et risque de contrepartie</h2><p>Binary.com offers forex and contracts for differences via a series of models - either solely dealing on own account (dealing desk), or wholly hedging client orders with the Company&#x27;s liquidity providers (no-dealing desk), or a hybrid model, depending on the Company with which the client has a contract. For the hybrid model, client orders are typically hedged when the total transaction volume exceeds a predefined threshold of risk tolerance level. For these execution models, Binary.com acts as the contractual counterparty to the transactions that the client enters into with the Company, as opposed to entering into a contractual counterparty with a central clearing house as would be the case with exchange-traded financial instruments. As such, counterparty risk exists. Counterparty risk refers to the risk of loss for clients resulting from the fact that the counterparty to the forex and/or contract-for-difference transaction that the client has entered into may default on its obligations prior to the final settlement of the transaction&#x27;s cash flow.</p><h2 data-anchor="leverage">Effet de levier</h2><p>Leverage, in the context of margin trading, refers to the use of margin to increase/amplify the value of a trade. Leverage is expressed as a ratio. A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that the client would be able to enter into a trade position that is of 50 times higher than the client&#x27;s margin. When the client invests in a leveraged product, the client&#x27;s profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e. the increased/amplified value of the client&#x27;s trade is determined based on the leverage ratio that the client has set for the client&#x27;s account.</p><p>Leverage can be used to generate returns that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction (the client&#x27;s margin). However, investments that have the potential to deliver greater investment returns carry higher levels of risk. This means that if the price movement is against the client&#x27;s favour, the client will suffer losses that are multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction (the client&#x27;s margin).</p><h2 data-anchor="relationship-between-margin-and-leverage">Relationship between margin and leverage</h2><p>The leverage ratio refers to the number of times that the client&#x27;s margin (the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction) can be &quot;leveraged&quot; to enter into a transaction. The denominator of the leverage ratio is always one. A 50:1 leverage is equivalent to a 2% margin requirement (1 divided by 50 = 2%). The leverage ratio that the Company/the client establishes will determine the amount of margin required. As leverage is inversely proportional to margin, as the leverage that the client sets for the client&#x27;s account gets lower, the margin required to be set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance (the client&#x27;s margin requirement) gets higher.</p><h2 data-anchor="risk-of-stop-order">Risk of stop order</h2><p>The system fills orders on a first-in, first-out basis, i.e. based on the sequence of the order received, and this is beyond the Company&#x27;s control. As a result, the client may find it difficult or impossible to close a position at the intended price stipulated in the client&#x27;s stop order during certain market conditions. The placement of stop order by the client, though useful as a risk management tool, will not necessarily limit the client&#x27;s losses to the client&#x27;s intended amounts in the event of highly volatile trading conditions, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders, and there is uncertainty about the client&#x27;s possible exit price. In short, a stop order is not guaranteed because it cannot operate in all market circumstances.</p><h2 data-anchor="regular-monitoring">Suivi standard des positions ouvertes</h2><p>Trading forex and contracts for differences carries a high level of risk and Binary.com does not monitor the open positions of the client&#x27;s account on the client&#x27;s behalf. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to monitor the client&#x27;s open positions and understand the exposure of the client&#x27;s open positions whilst ensuring that the client&#x27;s exposure commensurate with the client&#x27;s risk appetite. Due to the cost associated with overnight open positions, the client should consider investing in the market of the instrument in which the client ordinarily transacts instead of investing in a CFD.</p><h2 data-anchor="risk-of-slippage">Risque de baisse</h2><p>Whilst the Company endeavours to open or close the transaction to which the client&#x27;s orders relate at the requested price, acting in accordance with the Company&#x27;s duty of best execution, there are times when, due to an increase in volatility or volume, orders may be subject to slippage. The difference between the order price and execution price when orders are filled is known as slippage. This means that the client&#x27;s order is not filled at the exact intended quoted price when the client places their order. Slippage is usually seen during periods of extremely high or low volatility and generally occurs during fundamental news releases or periods of limited liquidity. Slippages can result in either a positive slippage (more favourable to the client) or a negative slippage (less favourable to the client).</p><h2 data-anchor="external-forces">Forces externes</h2><p>The client&#x27;s forex and contract-for-difference transactions with Binary.com are linked to an underlying financial instrument, and the client will be exposed to price, currency exchange, interest rate, or other volatility of the market to which the client&#x27;s financial instrument is related to, especially if the market is of a jurisdiction that is foreign to the client. Forex and contract-for-difference trading over the Internet via an electronic trading platform is subject to data latency risk, which may result in delays in order execution.</p></div></div><div id="order-execution-binary-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="summary-order-execution-policy">Résumé de la politique d&#x27;exécution des ordres</h2><p>The Company has a general duty to conduct its business with the client honestly, fairly, and professionally and to act in the client&#x27;s best interests when opening and closing Binary Options trades with the client.</p><p>More specifically, when the Company enters into a Binary Option trade with the client (each, a &quot;Contract&quot;), the Company has a duty to provide the client with &#x27;best execution&#x27;.

Client orders will be executed by the Company and the Company will always be the client&#x27;s sole execution venue for all of the trades a client makes in binary options. This means that the Company will always act as the client&#x27;s counterparty, wherein it takes the other side of the client&#x27;s trade. The clients should be aware that they are exposed to higher risks as all Binary Options contracts are traded on over-the-counter (OTC) markets, as opposed to regulated exchanges.
