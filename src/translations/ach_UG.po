For these execution models, %1 acts as the contractual counterparty to the transactions that the client enters into with the Company, as opposed to entering into a contractual counterparty with a central clearing house as would be the case with exchange-traded financial instruments. As such, counterparty risk exists.

In such cases, the automatic Margin close-out protection might fail, causing the client's Account Balance to fall below zero. For this purpose, a Negative Balance Protection mechanism has been introduced. Negative Balance Protection provides a 'backstop' in case of extreme market conditions and ensures that the client's maximum losses from trading CFDs, including all related costs, are limited to the balance available on the client's CFD account. Therefore, the client can never lose more money than the total sum invested for trading CFDs; if the client's CFD account balance falls below zero, the Company will compensate the negative balance as soon as possible without any additional cost to the client."
