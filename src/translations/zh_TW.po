Negative Balance Protection provides a 'backstop' in case of extreme market conditions and ensures that the client's maximum losses from trading CFDs, including all related costs, are limited to the balance available on the client's CFD account. Therefore, the client can never lose more money than the total sum invested for trading CFDs; if the client's CFD account balance falls below zero, the Company will compensate the negative balance as soon as possible without any additional cost to the client."
