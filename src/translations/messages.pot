For these execution models, %1 acts as the contractual counterparty to the transactions that the client enters into with the Company, as opposed to entering into a contractual counterparty with a central clearing house as would be the case with exchange-traded financial instruments. As such, counterparty risk exists. Counterparty risk refers to the risk of loss for clients resulting from the fact that the counterparty to the forex and/or contract-for-difference transaction that the client has entered into may default on its obligations prior to the final settlement of the transaction's cash flow."

A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that the client would be able to enter into a trade position that is of 50 times higher than the client's margin. When the client invests in a leveraged product, the client's profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e. the increased/amplified value of the client's trade is determined based on the leverage ratio that the client has set for the client's account."
