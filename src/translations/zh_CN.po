This means that if the price movement is against the client's favour, the client will suffer losses that are multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client's account balance to open and maintain a transaction (the client's margin)."
msgstr "杠杆可以用于生成比从客户的账户余额拨出进行开盘持仓交易（客户的保证金）的金额高出多倍的回报。然而，进行可能带来更大投资回报的投资具更高风险。这意味着，如果价格走势对客户不利，客户将蒙受比从其账户余额拨出进行开盘持仓交易（客户的保证金）的金额高出多倍的亏损。"

A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that the client would be able to enter into a trade position that is of 50 times higher than the client's margin. When the client invests in a leveraged product, the client's profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e. the increased/amplified value of the client's trade is determined based on the leverage ratio that the client has set for the client's account."
msgstr "融资融券交易中，杠杆指使用保证金增加/扩大交易数值。杠杆的表达方式是比率。举个例子，如果杠杆是50: 1，客户将能够持有比保证金高出 50 倍的交易头寸。当客户投资一种杠杆产品时，客户的盈利或亏损将根据杠杆的头寸计算，也就是说，客户为账户设置的杠杆比率决定了其交易增加/扩大数值。"
