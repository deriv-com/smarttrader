The calculation will include a bias in favour of the Company. The financial contract prices (or the payout amounts) offered to clients speculating on market or index prices may substantially differ from prices available in the primary markets where commodities or contracts thereupon are traded, due to the bias favouring the Company in the price calculation system referred to above.</p><p>The charting data made available to clients by the Company is indicative only and may at times differ from the real market values. The Company&#x27;s decision as to the calculation of a financial contract price will be final and binding.

Reasons for differences in feed providers include:</p><ul><li>关于外汇交易：外汇市场是银行和其他大型金融机构相互交易外汇的场外交易（OTC）市场，没有中央结算行。因此，外汇交易报价也没有“官方”价格来源。不同的数据源包含不同类型国际银行的报价。因此，根据其获得价格的银行不同，各外汇报价提供者的价格也不相同。</li><li>Market-closing times: The client is asked to refer to <a href="/zh_cn/resources/market_timesws.html">Trading times</a> page for the exact time of settlement for all contracts. Other websites may adopt a different convention (for example, some websites choose 4 o&#x27;clock NY time or 5 o&#x27;clock London time). As a result, the open, high, low, and closing prices displayed on the Company&#x27;s website may differ from those on other websites, due to the market-closing time convention.</li><li>Use of bid/ask prices: When the market is illiquid, the data feed may contain many bid and ask prices, without there actually being any traded price for quite a while. By taking an average of the bid/ask price (i.e. bid + ask, divided by 2), a market quote is generated that reflects the current market, without it actually being a traded price. The Company&#x27;s system will generate prices from these bid and ask prices, whereas other websites might not. As a result, the Company&#x27;s website might display ticks that do not appear in the data feeds of other websites.</li></ul><p>The Company&#x27;s data feed is designed to be one of the best and most robust available for a trading environment.</p><h2 data-anchor="weekend-quotes">周末报价</h2><p>The client is asked to note that weekend quotes are ignored for the purpose of contract settlement. During weekends, the forex markets may occasionally generate prices; however, these prices are often artificial (traders sometimes take advantage of the illiquidity of the markets during weekends to push prices up or down). To avoid settling prices based on such artificial prices, it is Company&#x27;s policy not to count weekend prices towards contract settlement values (except for Volatility Indices, which are open during weekends).</p></div></div><div id="privacy-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="security-and-privacy">安全隐私</h2><p>The Company recognises the importance of protecting the client&#x27;s personal and financial information.</p><p>公司获得的所有客户的信息有助于公司为客户和其账户提供服务。公司了解客户可能会对公司处理此类信息的方式感到忧虑。</p><p>The Company has outlined the Company&#x27;s privacy practices for the client as follows:</p><h2 data-anchor="use-of-information">Use of information</h2><p>The Company operates in full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable Data Protection laws. These regulatory measures place obligations on users of personal data like the Company. They also lay down the principles for fair and lawful processing of all the information that the Company acquires.</p><p>公司承诺将随时保护客户的在线隐私。客户的个人信息仅被公司用于账户服务、改善服务和提供客户需要的产品。公司不会向第三方出售客户的个人信息，但是为了方便交易，可能向支付提供者提供客户的个人信息。</p><p>The client&#x27;s personal information is used primarily as a way of validating the client as the legitimate account owner and proper recipient of withdrawal payments. The Company also uses this information to process the client&#x27;s trades. The Company collects from the client all personal and financial data directly relating to the client when the client fills in the Company&#x27;s account opening form. In all instances, the client has either a legal or a contractual obligation to provide the Company with the information. If such information is not provided, the Company will be unable to provide the client with its services.</p><p>The Company reserves the right to request further information from the client whenever deemed appropriate under the circumstances. For example, the Company may ask the client to send the Company additional acceptable documents to confirm the authenticity of the client&#x27;s account details or of any withdrawal request.</p><p>The Company holds all the personal data that the Company collects from the client with due diligence and only processes them for purposes as required or allowed by law. This includes the process of obtaining and sharing of certain information with third parties for credit or identity checks to comply with legal and regulatory obligations. In certain cases, the Company may process the client&#x27;s data to fulfill the Company&#x27;s contractual obligations with the client.</p><p>The Company also collects basic tax residence information for the purposes of CRS/FATCA compliance. The tax information that the client provides may only be disclosed to the authorities who are legally charged with collecting this information for CRS/FATCA reporting, and Binary.com will only do so to the extent that is legally obliged to collect it from the clients and disclose it to the authorities. The Company does not use, disclose, or process this information in any other way at any time.</p><p>The client may update the client&#x27;s personal information at any time by logging in to the &quot;Settings&quot; section of the client&#x27;s account. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to ensure that Binary.com is promptly and continually informed of any change in the client&#x27;s personal information. The client should note that if the client provides the Company with inaccurate information, or if the client fails to notify the Company of any changes to the information previously supplied by the client, this may adversely affect the quality of the services that the Company can provide.</p><h2 data-anchor="profiling-and-categorisation">Profiling and categorisation</h2><p>The Company collects and assesses the client&#x27;s data to profile the client in relation to the Company&#x27;s products.

In all instances, the Company places a contractual obligation on such third parties to offer the same level of rights and protection as stipulated in the GDPR.</p><p>The client also has the right to request copies of any personal information that the client has provided to the Company and to request that the Company transmit such information to other service providers.</p><h2 data-anchor="consent">同意</h2><p>When the client opens an account with the Company, the Company will request the client&#x27;s consent for the distribution of marketing materials to the e-mail address that the client provides to the Company upon sign-up.</p><h2 data-anchor="right-of-object">Right to object</h2><p>The client has the right to object to the direct distribution of marketing materials.

In both cases, the Company will refrain from distributing marketing materials to the client.</p><h2 data-anchor="access-to-personal-data">个人数据访问</h2><p>除非Binary.com的关键人员在执行职务时有此必要，严格禁止任何人访问客户的个人数据。</p><p>如果Binary.com因法律、法规或具有司法管辖权的法庭或政府机构的规定，必须公布客户的个人或财务信息，除非法律不允许，公司将按其认为恰当的方式及时通知客户，使客户有机会对相关数据采取恰当的保护措施。该必要的公布行为不可解释为违反此协议条款和条件。</p><p>The client also has the right to request that the Company copy, modify, or remove the client&#x27;s personal information as long as such actions do not breach any legal or regulatory obligations that the Company may have.</p></div><h2 data-anchor="data-retention">数据保留</h2><p>如果客户选择关闭其％1账户，公司将会保留客户的数据，直到已经完成履行数据保留方面的法律和监管义务。一旦适用的保留期限届满，公司将删除客户的数据。</p><h2 data-anchor="security-statement">Security statement</h2><p>Taking the following measures, the Company is committed to making sure that the client&#x27;s personal data and transactions are secure:</p><ol><li>The client&#x27;s password and login ID are unique, and passwords are hashed so that not even Binary.com staff can read them. This is the reason why the Company cannot retrieve the client&#x27;s password and has to issue the client with a new one, sent to the client&#x27;s email address, if the client cannot recall it.</li><li>The Company maintains customer balances in cash or cash equivalent. The Company ensures that 100% of each customer&#x27;s balance is available for immediate withdrawal, subject to verification.</li><li>所有信用卡信息都按照银行政策，使用最新 SSL 加密技术直接提交至 Visa/Mastercard 网络。</li><li>The Company&#x27;s information security policies are based on industry best practices in access control and business continuity.</li><li>The Company uses identity verification services and real-time fraud detection measures to help protect the client from unauthorised access to the client&#x27;s account.

Such independence-upholding procedures can be followed, for example, through the operation of information barriers, physical separation of staff, the segregation of duties and responsibilities, and the maintenance of a policy of independence, which requires the Company&#x27;s staff, when providing services to a client, to act in the best interests of the client and to disregard any conflicts of interest, or in some circumstances, to decline to act for a client or potential client in order to avoid conflicts of interest.</p><h2 data-anchor="disclosure-general">揭露(一般)</h2><p>The organisational and administrative arrangements established by the Company to prevent or manage a conflict are not sufficient to ensure, with reasonable confidence, that the risk of damage to the interest of the client will be prevented.

Therefore, trading in Binary Options is appropriate only for persons that understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal, and other risks involved in such transactions. The client should be satisfied that Binary Options trading is suitable for the client in light of the client&#x27;s investment circumstances and attitude towards risk before trading. The client should not engage in speculative Binary Options trading unless the client understands the basic aspects of such trading and its risks. If the client is in any doubt as to whether Binary Option trading is appropriate and suitable for the client, the client should seek independent advice from an investment consulting professional. Binary.com does not provide such advice. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility, taking into account the client&#x27;s personal circumstances and investment resources, to take particular care and make careful considerations independently, both prior to applying to engage in Binary Options with Binary.com and prior to making any individual order. Where the client does not understand the risks involved in applying for a trading account with Binary.com or in making any individual order, the client should seek advice and consultation from an independent investment advisor. If the client continues to not understand the risks involved in trading in Binary Options, the client should not trade at all.</p><p>The client is advised that the Binary Options offered by Binary.com are not traded under the rules of any recognised, designated, or regulated exchange. Consequently, engaging in Binary Options trading may expose the client to substantially greater risks than the investments that are so traded.</p><p>The client is warned of the following additional risks:</p><p>衍生投资工具（如二元期权和相关市场）的波动性很大。二元期权所涉及的基础工具价格可能会快速起伏，且幅度很大，很可能出现客户和 Binary.com 皆无法控制的突发事件或状况变化。</p><p>Binary.com 努力让二元期权所提交的每个标的资产报价与该资产的实际市价保持合理的关系。Binary.com 不保证、表达或意味着所报的价代表市价。</p><p>Binary.com 可能有权限获取客户所无法得到的信息，也可能以客户无法得到的低价获取交易头寸，并可能跟客户的利益有所不同。Binary.com 没有义务为客户提供公司所拥有的市场或其他信息，也不会对公司自己的交易做出任何变更或限制。</p><p>任何标的工具或资产上一次的表现不可保证其当前或未来的表现。以前的表现并不能作为未来结果的可靠指标。</p><h2 data-anchor="risks-of-investment-products">产品投资风险</h2><p>合同投资或交易使客户和Binary合同指向的标的、参考工具或资产的表现息息相关，包括外汇、指数和大宗商品，每一种都各有特点和风险。</p><p>兑换率风险: 外汇兑换率可能会因为广泛的经济、政治和其他条件而快速改变，因此，客户在进行标的投资产品交易时除了隐藏性损失风险之外，还冒着兑换率损失风险。如果客户以某一种货币存入资金，但以另一种货币进行合同交易计价，客户的标的投资收益或损失可能会受到两种货币间兑换率变动的影响。</p><p>Other Risks: There are other risks related to trading Investment Products and foreign currencies that cannot be described in detail in this document. Generally, however, securities, options, and currency transactions involve exposure to a combination of the following risk factors: market risk, credit risk, settlement risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. For example, there can be serious market disruptions if local or overseas economic, political, or other unforeseen events affect the market. In addition to these types of risk, there may be other factors such as accounting and tax treatment issues that the client should consider.</p><h2 data-anchor="market-opinions">Market opinions</h2><p>网站所载的一切意见、新闻、研究、分析、价格和其他信息都是一般的市场评论，不构成投资建议。Binary.com 将不会承担任何损失或损害，包括但不限于使用或依赖该信息造成的直接或间接利润损失。</p><h2 data-anchor="internet-trading-risks">网上交易风险</h2><p>There are risks associated with utilising an Internet-based deal execution trading system, including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware, software, and Internet connection. Since Binary.com does not control signal power, its reception or routing via Internet, the configuration of the client&#x27;s equipment, or the reliability of its connection, the Company cannot be responsible for communication failures, distortions, or delays during online trading.</p><h2 data-anchor="accuracy-of-information">信息的准确性</h2><p>公司有权随时更改本网站内容, 恕不另行通知, 且其唯一目的仅为交易商在作出独立投资决定时提供协助。Binary.com 已采取合理措施确保网站上信息的准确性。</p><h2 data-anchor="costs-and-charges">成本和费用</h2><p>The Company&#x27;s costs and charges for depositing and withdrawing money are set out <a href="/zh_cn/cashier/payment_methods.html">here</a>. The client should be aware of all costs and charges that apply to the client because they will affect the client&#x27;s profitability.</p></div></div><div id="risk-mt-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="risk-disclosure-statement">Risk disclosure statement</h2><p>This risk disclosure statement is not exhaustive and is not intended to constitute a comprehensive statement of all the risks to which the client might be exposed and does not describe all the risks inherent to forex and contracts for differences that exist now or which may arise in the future. Its objective is rather to provide the client with information, so that the client can reasonably understand the risks associated with forex and contracts for differences offered by Binary.com, as it is the Company&#x27;s intention to provide the client with the best possible trading experience.</p><h2 data-anchor="forex-and-cfd-high-risk">外汇和差价交易合约涉及高风险，是一种投机活动</h2><p>外汇和差价交易合约涉及高风险，是一种投机活动，因为客户可推测基础金融工具价格的短期变动。除非客户能接受比其存入资金更大的亏损，不然客户不适合参与外汇交易和 （或） 签订差价交易合约。重要的是客户需了解，如果要从持仓头寸获取任何回报，客户必须参与相应的交易将持仓头寸平仓，有时候在一些市场条件下客户可能很难或无法做到此点。</p><h2 data-anchor="execution-model">执行模型和交易对手风险</h2><p>Binary.com通过一系列的模式提供外汇和差价合约，即通过自己的账户（交易员）和全对冲客户订单与公司的流动率提供商（无交易员）或混合模式进行交易，视公司与客户是否有合约而定。如是混合模式，当总交易量超过预定的风险承受力水平限额时，客户订单通常被对冲。Binary.com在此类执行模式中都扮演客户与公司签订交易的合约相对方，而不是像交易所的交易金融工具那样与中央结算所订立交易的合约相对方。 因此，存在相对方风险。 相对方风险是指客户因为其签订的外汇和/或差价交易合约相对方在交易现金流最终结算前违反其义务而造成的损失风险。</p><h2 data-anchor="leverage">杠杆</h2><p>融资融券交易中，杠杆指使用保证金增加/扩大交易数值。杠杆的表达方式是比率。举个例子，如果杠杆是50: 1，客户将能够持有比保证金高出 50 倍的交易头寸。当客户投资一种杠杆产品时，客户的盈利或亏损将根据杠杆的头寸计算，也就是说，客户为账户设置的杠杆比率决定了其交易增加/扩大数值。</p><p>杠杆可以用于生成比从客户的账户余额拨出进行开盘持仓交易（客户的保证金）的金额高出多倍的回报。然而，进行可能带来更大投资回报的投资具更高风险。这意味着，如果价格走势对客户不利，客户将蒙受比从其账户余额拨出进行开盘持仓交易（客户的保证金）的金额高出多倍的亏损。</p><h2 data-anchor="relationship-between-margin-and-leverage">Relationship between margin and leverage</h2><p>The leverage ratio refers to the number of times that the client&#x27;s margin (the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction) can be &quot;leveraged&quot; to enter into a transaction. The denominator of the leverage ratio is always one. A 50:1 leverage is equivalent to a 2% margin requirement (1 divided by 50 = 2%). The leverage ratio that the Company/the client establishes will determine the amount of margin required. As leverage is inversely proportional to margin, as the leverage that the client sets for the client&#x27;s account gets lower, the margin required to be set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance (the client&#x27;s margin requirement) gets higher.</p><h2 data-anchor="risk-of-stop-order">Risk of stop order</h2><p>The system fills orders on a first-in, first-out basis, i.e. based on the sequence of the order received, and this is beyond the Company&#x27;s control. As a result, the client may find it difficult or impossible to close a position at the intended price stipulated in the client&#x27;s stop order during certain market conditions. The placement of stop order by the client, though useful as a risk management tool, will not necessarily limit the client&#x27;s losses to the client&#x27;s intended amounts in the event of highly volatile trading conditions, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders, and there is uncertainty about the client&#x27;s possible exit price. In short, a stop order is not guaranteed because it cannot operate in all market circumstances.</p><h2 data-anchor="regular-monitoring">定期监测未平仓头寸</h2><p>Trading forex and contracts for differences carries a high level of risk and Binary.com does not monitor the open positions of the client&#x27;s account on the client&#x27;s behalf. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to monitor the client&#x27;s open positions and understand the exposure of the client&#x27;s open positions whilst ensuring that the client&#x27;s exposure commensurate with the client&#x27;s risk appetite. Due to the cost associated with overnight open positions, the client should consider investing in the market of the instrument in which the client ordinarily transacts instead of investing in a CFD.</p><h2 data-anchor="risk-of-slippage">滑点风险</h2><p>Whilst the Company endeavours to open or close the transaction to which the client&#x27;s orders relate at the requested price, acting in accordance with the Company&#x27;s duty of best execution, there are times when, due to an increase in volatility or volume, orders may be subject to slippage. The difference between the order price and execution price when orders are filled is known as slippage. This means that the client&#x27;s order is not filled at the exact intended quoted price when the client places their order. Slippage is usually seen during periods of extremely high or low volatility and generally occurs during fundamental news releases or periods of limited liquidity. Slippages can result in either a positive slippage (more favourable to the client) or a negative slippage (less favourable to the client).</p><h2 data-anchor="external-forces">外部力量</h2><p>The client&#x27;s forex and contract-for-difference transactions with Binary.com are linked to an underlying financial instrument, and the client will be exposed to price, currency exchange, interest rate, or other volatility of the market to which the client&#x27;s financial instrument is related to, especially if the market is of a jurisdiction that is foreign to the client. Forex and contract-for-difference trading over the Internet via an electronic trading platform is subject to data latency risk, which may result in delays in order execution.</p></div></div><div id="order-execution-binary-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="summary-order-execution-policy">订单执行政策摘要</h2><p>The Company has a general duty to conduct its business with the client honestly, fairly, and professionally and to act in the client&#x27;s best interests when opening and closing Binary Options trades with the client.</p><p>More specifically, when the Company enters into a Binary Option trade with the client (each, a &quot;Contract&quot;), the Company has a duty to provide the client with &#x27;best execution&#x27;.

This means that the Company will always act as the client&#x27;s counterparty, wherein it takes the other side of the client&#x27;s trade. The clients should be aware that they are exposed to higher risks as all Binary Options contracts are traded on over-the-counter (OTC) markets, as opposed to regulated exchanges.
