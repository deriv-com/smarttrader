Such rules may change from time to time, according to market conditions and other factors. The following indicative rules are currently in place:<ul class="bullet"><li>Contracts will not usually be offered at odds under 0.05 to 1 (i.e. payouts of under USD/GBP/EUR/AUD 1.05 for each USD/GBP/EUR/AUD 1 staked).</li><li>Contracts offered by Binary Investments (Europe) Ltd. have a minimum purchase price of USD/GBP/EUR 5.</li><li>Contracts are not usually offered in the last hour of trade of any given market (for foreign exchange markets, the restriction may be extended up to 3 hours).</li><li>Contracts will not usually be offered when the underlying market is at its intraday high or intraday low.</li><li>Contracts will not usually be offered during the first 10 minutes of market trade.</li><li>During fast markets (i.e. periods of very fast market movements), contracts may be offered at prices more unfavourable than those offered in usual market conditions.</li><li>Certain limits are imposed as to the acceptable levels for barrier/strike prices of contracts. Typically, the barrier/strike may not be too close nor too far from the current underlying market level.</li><li>Contracts may not expire on a weekend; therefore, the expiry date of a contract may be pushed back to the following Monday in the event of a contract expiry date falling on a Saturday or a Sunday.</li><li>Market prices are updated at most once per second.  For any given second, the market price will be updated to the first tick, if any, received in that particular second on the company data feed.</li><li>The company does not guarantee the ability to sell a contract prior to its expiration time.</li></ul><h2 data-anchor="contract-payouts">Contract Payouts</h2><p>Contract payouts shall be determined by the Company by reference to the daily high/low/close values reported on this website relevant to the underlying index(ices) of the contract(s) or from the interbank trading data received by the Company for forex quotes or commodities prices as displayed on the website, subject that the Company shall have the right to make corrections to such data in the event of mispriced or typographically incorrect data. Clients should note that the different markets may close at different times during the day due to local trading hours and time zones.</p><p>For forex quotes the closing times are defined by the Company as shown in the Market Opening Times section of the website. In the event of any dispute regarding market or settlement values, the decision of the Company shall be final and binding. Clients should note that certain markets (such as indices) are not open throughout the day and that trading may not be available when the markets are closed.</p><p>The calculation of the price to be paid (or the payout to be received) for financial contracts on this site at the time the financial contract is purchased or sold will be based on the Company&#x27;s best estimate of market price movements and the expected level of interest rates, implied volatilities and other market conditions during the life of the financial contract, and is based on complex mathematics. The calculation will include a bias in favour of the Company. The financial contract prices (or the payout amounts) offered to Clients speculating on market or index prices may differ substantially from prices available in the primary markets where commodities or contracts thereupon are traded, due to the bias favouring the Company in the price calculation system referred to above.</p><p>The charting data made available to Clients by the Company is indicative only and may at times differ from the real market values. The Company&#x27;s decision as to the calculation of a financial contract price will be final and binding. The Company allows the option to sell contracts before expiry time of some contracts but will not be obliged to do so and can suspend this option depending on the current market conditions. Contracts may be amended when the underlying asset value is adjusted by corporate actions during the contract period.</p><p>Should a disruption occur in the data feeds which cannot be readily rectified by the Company, the Company reserves the right to refund the contract purchase.</p><h2 data-anchor="trading-limits">Trading Limits</h2><p>The Company reserves the right to have in place risk limits, which affects the trading limits of all clients trading, and may not be limited solely to instruments and contract types.</p><p>The Company may also impose volume trading limits on Client accounts at its sole discretion.

If your Account Equity is less than the Margin Requirement in relation to the open Transaction you wish to create, you have entered into a Margin Call and you are required to fund the shortfall immediately. You may not be able to place an Order to open a Transaction until the shortfall has been funded and there is sufficient Account Equity to cover the Total Margin.</li><li>You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to monitor your Account Balance and Margin Requirement and we are not under any obligation to keep you informed (i.e., to make a Margin Call).</li></ol></li><li>Margin Requirement and Calculation<ol><li>The Margin Requirement is a percentage of the value of the Open Positions and will continue to fluctuate in accordance with the value of the Open Positions throughout the duration of the relevant contracts (the &quot;Contract Value&quot;).</li><li>Margin Requirements can increase/decrease based on the aggregated size of your Open Position determined by the volume (number of lots), contract size (value per point in the original currency of the contract), market price, and margin rate.</li><li>We may modify Margin Requirements for any Open Positions or new Transactions entered into, at our sole discretion. Formulas for Margin Requirements published on the website are indicative only and may be changed by the Company at its discretion at any time, due to changing market conditions or other factors.</li><li>Whilst we endeavor to close out your Open Positions if and when the Margin Level for your MT5 Real Account reaches or falls below the Stop Out Level, we do not guarantee that your Open Positions will be closed when the Margin Level for your MT5 Real Account reaches the Stop Out Level.</li><li>For fully covered accounts, no margin will be charged on open positions. However, swaps and other applicable fees can cause your Account Equity to turn negative. In that case the Stop Out process will be triggered.</li></ol></li><li>Stop Out Level<ol><li>If the Margin Level for your MT5 Real Account reaches or falls below the Stop Out Level, this will be classified as an Event of Default.

Additionally, for perfectly hedged positions, Stop Out will be performed on accounts having open positions, the zero margin (positions are covered), and negative equity.</li><li>The default Stop Out Level applicable to your Account is published on our website. However, the default Stop Out Level is subject to alteration at our absolute discretion. Any changes to the Stop Out Level will take effect immediately. We will endeavor to notify you of an alteration to the default Stop Out Level by publishing the revised default Stop Out Level on our website. It is your responsibility to check our website regularly and remain informed about the default Stop Out Level.</li><li>The Stop Out Level applicable to your MT5 Real Account may differ from the default Stop Out Level published on our website.</li><li data-show="-eucountry">Negative Balance Protection<ol><li>The Company has a Stop Out policy which prevents you from losing more than you have deposited. However, in the event that your Open Positions are not closed when the Margin Level for your MT5 Real Account reaches the Stop Out Level, the Company, at its sole discretion, may waive your negative balance by crediting your account if your Account Balance goes into a negative balance. The negative balance is determined by aggregating all the negative balances incurred over a 24-hour period across all accounts held by you. You acknowledge that, unless you are a retail customer of Binary Investments (Europe) Ltd, the offer of the Negative Balance protection by the Company to you is at the Company’s sole discretion and we reserve the right to change the features and eligibility criteria of the Negative Balance Protection at any time. The provisions of the Negative Balance Protection do not apply:<ol><li>in the case of a force majeure event;</li><li>in abnormal market conditions or exceptional market movements/volatility;</li><li>in the case of a client opening any Transaction in relation to Prohibited Trades;</li><li>in the case of Professional Clients;</li><li>where the negative balance is connected to or a result of functional limitations and/or malfunction of the MT5 Trading Platform; and</li><li>in the case of a client breaching any of the terms of this Agreement which results in a negative balance.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Margin Payment<ol><li>You may make Margin Payments by transferring funds from your Binary.com account to your MT5 Real Account.

The Scheme is based on EC Directive 97/9.</p><p>Cover is made available on the basis of the depositor rather than on the basis of the number of deposits, meaning that if an individual has multiple accounts he will only be covered as to €20,000 on the global amount. Any other amount exceeding such threshold is not protected and will thus have to be borne by the investor.</p></li><li>Professional Clients<p>If you ask to be treated as a Professional Client, you need to meet certain specified quantitative and qualitative criteria. On the basis of your request to be categorised as Professional, the Company undertakes an assessment of your expertise, knowledge and experience to determine whether you fall within this Category and whether you are able to make your own investment decisions and understand the risks involved. If the relevant criteria are not met, the Company reserves the right to choose whether to provide its services under this requested classification.</p><p>Professional Clients are offered the possibility to request reclassification, and thus increase the level of regulatory protection afforded, at any time during the relationship.</p><p>The Company shall not be obliged to provide Professional Clients with the following:</p><ol><li>Assessment of appropriateness of the requested service or product as we assume that you appreciate the risks associated with such investment services and products offered by the Company;</li><li>risk warnings and notices related to transactions and investments in the proposed instruments;</li><li>educational material;</li><li>compensation under Investor Compensation Scheme.</li></ol></li><li>Eligible Counterparties<p>When you are classified as an Eligible Counterparty we shall not provide you with:</p><ol><li>Best Execution Requirements;</li><li>Assessment of appropriateness of the requested service or product as we assume that you appreciate risk disclosures associated with the requested investment services and products offered by the Company; </li><li>risk warnings and notices related to your transactions;</li><li>Client Reporting;</li><li>The Investors Compensation Scheme.</li></ol></li></ol></ol></li><li><strong>Assessment of Appropriateness</strong><p>Before the provision of our services, we conduct an appropriateness test for our Retail Clients, in accordance with our Regulatory obligations and in order to determine whether, on the basis of the Regulatory Criteria and information provided by you, you have the necessary skills, knowledge, expertise and experience in the investment field to understand the risks involved in the specific type of product or service requested.</p><p>The Company shall assume that the information provided by the client is accurate and complete. The Company shall bear no responsibility if such information is inaccurate and/or incomplete.</p><p>You should get independent advice from an investment adviser if you have any doubts about dealing in margined products.</p></li><li><strong>Payments &amp; Withdrawals</strong><ol><li>Funding of MT5 Real Account<p>When you transfer your money to us for trading purposes, your funds are deposited in your Binary.com account. If you choose to trade FX and CFDs you shall transfer funds from your Binary.com account to your MT5 Real Account. Such transfer shall not be regarded as a transfer from two different Accounts but as a transfer of funds from your centralised Binary.com account to the MT5 Real Account. No fund transfers shall be made to any other Account in the name of any third party.</p><p>As our Client, you agree to comply with the following when making payments to the Company:</p><ol><li>Deposits and/or payments due are to be made in the currency chosen by you from the ones specified by the Company from time to time;</li><li>You are responsible for all third-party electronic transfer fees in respect of payments;</li><li>Payments made to the Company will only be deemed to have been received once the Company receives cleared funds; </li><li>You bear the responsibility of ensuring that payments made to the Company are correctly received with the specified Client’s Account details.</li></ol><p>There are no charges for transferring money from your Binary.com account to your MT5 Real Account.</p></li><li>Transfer of Funds from the MT5 Real Account<p>If you have a positive balance in your MT5 Real Account, you may transfer such balance from your MT5 Real Account into your Binary.com account and then request a withdrawal as necessary for any amount available on your Binary.com account. The Company may withhold, deduct or refuse to make any such transfer or withdrawal, in whole or in part, if:</p><ol><li>You have Open Positions on the Account showing a loss;</li><li>Such transfer would result in your Account Equity being less than zero; </li><li>The requested transfer would reduce your Account balance to less than the Margin required for your Open Positions;</li><li>The Company reasonably considers that funds may be required to meet any current or future Margin Requirements on Open Positions due to the underlying market conditions;</li><li>The Company reasonably determines that there is an unresolved dispute between the Company and the Client relating to the agreed Terms and Agreements;</li><li>There is any amount outstanding from you to us; and/or</li><li>We are required to do so in accordance with any relevant Law or Regulation.</li></ol><p>Your MT5 Real Account as well as all payments and withdrawals therefrom must be made in the same currency as maintained in your Binary.com account.</p></li><li>Negative Balance Protection<p>When using the MT5 Trading Platform, all our clients will be provided with margin monitoring functionality to protect you from encountering negative balances when trading under normal market conditions. As a trader, you should always, and at all times maintain the appropriate levels of margin in your trading account as the recommended method of your own risk management.</p><p>If your usable margin drops below 100%, a margin call mode will be triggered and maintained till the level of 50%. In the event that your margin level is equal to, or drops below 50%, the Company will initiate the closing of your current open positions, starting from the most unprofitable until the required margin level is achieved. In such events, the positions will be automatically closed at the current market price at that point in time.</p><p>In exceptional circumstances, where there is a price change in the underlying that is sufficiently large and sudden, gapping can occur. In such cases, the automatic margin close-out protection might fail, causing your account balance to fall below zero. For this purpose, a Negative Balance Protection mechanism has been introduced. Negative Balance Protection provides a ‘backstop’ in case of extreme market conditions and ensures that your maximum losses from trading CFDs, including all related costs, are limited to the balance available on your CFD account. Therefore, you can never lose more money than the total sum invested for trading CFDs; if your CFD account balance falls below zero, the Company will compensate the negative balance as soon as possible without any additional cost to you.</p><p>Negative Balance Protection does not apply to clients categorized as professional traders, who can still lose more money than their available balance.</p><p>The Company does not offer credit to its clients. You acknowledge and agree that you will not be dealing with us on credit.</p></li></ol></li><li><strong>Account Closure</strong><p>If you wish to withdraw funds from your MT5 Real Account and/or close your MT5 Real Account, you may notify us by contacting our helpdesk at <a href="mailto:support@binary.com">support@binary.com</a>. Your MT5 Real Account may be closed if you do not have any Open Positions and all amounts due to us have been settled.</p></li></ol><h2 data-anchor="market-execution">Market Execution</h2><p>On the MT5 Trading Platform, you will benefit from Direct Market Access that gives you the opportunity to receive the best possible price in the market at a specified time, without having to use a dealing desk.</p><p>As a result, your trades are executed at market as follows:</p><ol><li>The price of your chosen investment appears on the platform/on your screen;</li><li>By clicking buy or sell, your order will be filled at the best possible price with either one of our liquidity providers or on our own books (according to the best streaming price at the time of your order placement);</li><li>When the order hits the liquidity provider’s server, or our server in case the order is taken on our own books, it is fulfilled.</li></ol><p>Please be advised that prices can change very quickly in the market, so the execution price may not necessarily be visible instantly once the order has been filled.</p><p>Also consider that your internet connection can influence what price is displayed after the trade has been executed.</p><h2 data-anchor="expert-advisors">Expert Advisors</h2><p>Expert Advisors, including any additional functions/plug-ins of trading operations provided by or developed using Expert Advisors, are applications developed using the MetaQuotes Language which can be used to analyse price charts and automate your trades.</p><p>Expert Advisors made available on the MT5 Trading Platform, are owned by MetaQuotes Software Corporation (the MT5 Trading Platform Licensor) and shall remain the exclusive property of MetaQuotes Software Corporation.</p><p>The Company is an independent legal entity and is not affiliated with the MT5 Trading Platform.

The Company will not be liable for any financial losses incurred using a third-party software. The Company is not associated with the development of the automated trading software or the Expert Advisors because they are exclusively developed and supported by third parties and not by the Company.

The purpose of this filtering algorithm is to strip the feed of stray ticks. Stray ticks are ticks that manifestly fall outside of the current trading range of the market; such ticks are often due to communication delays with the exchanges or banks that provide quotes, human error, or database problems at any point between the originator of the quote and our servers.</p><p>The filtering algorithm may for example be similar to the &quot;Bollinger Bands&quot; volatility system - i.e., short-term volatility bands are determined around the present market value, and ticks that are manifestly outside of such bands are removed.</p><h2 data-anchor="smoothing-out-random-noise">Smoothing out random noise</h2><p>Depending on the quality of the feeds received from our feed providers, our servers might also apply a very short-term smoothing algorithm to the data feed. This smoothing algorithm removes a little of the &quot;random noise&quot; surrounding the data feed, and ensures that clients who buy path-dependent contracts (such as the one-touch or barrier-range contracts) will not have their contracts knocked-in or knocked-out by random short-term market noise that does not reflect the true market price.</p><h2 data-anchor="differences-with-other-data-feeds">Differences with other data feeds</h2><p>Our data feed may at times differ slightly from other data feeds found on the internet (who may themselves differ between each other). Reasons for differences in feed providers include:</p><ul><li>For forex: The forex market is an OTC (over the counter) market, where banks and other major financial institutions trade currencies amongst themselves without there being any central clearing house. Accordingly, there is no &#x27;official&#x27; price source for forex quotes. Different data feeds will contain quotes from a different sub-set of international banks. Accordingly prices may differ between providers, depending on which bank(s) they obtain prices from.</li><li>The smoothing and filtering algorithms described above.</li><li>Market-closing times: Please refer to <a href="/en/resources/market_timesws.html">Trading Times</a> page for the exact time of settlement for all contracts. Other websites may adopt a different convention (for example some websites choose 4 o&#x27;clock NY time, or 5 o&#x27;clock London time). As a result, the open, high, low and closing prices displayed on our website may differ to those on other websites, due to the market-closing time convention.</li><li>Use of bid/ask prices: when the market is illiquid, the data feed may contain many bid and ask prices, without there actually being any traded price for quite a while. By taking an average of the bid/ask price (i.e. bid + ask, divided by 2), a market quote is generated that reflects the current market, without it actually being a traded price. Our system will generate prices from these bid and ask prices, whereas other websites might not. As a result, our website might display ticks that do not appear in the data feeds of other websites.</li></ul><p>Our data feed is designed to be one of the best and most robust available for a trading environment.</p><h2 data-anchor="weekend-quotes">Weekend quotes</h2><p>Please note that weekend quotes are ignored for the purpose of contract settlement. During weekends, the forex markets may occasionally generate prices, however these prices are often artificial (traders sometimes take advantage of the illiquidity of the markets during weekends to push up or down prices). To avoid settling prices based on such artificial prices, it is Binary.com&#x27;s policy not to count weekend prices towards contract settlement values (except for the volatility indices, which are open during weekends).</p></div></div><div id="privacy-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="security-and-privacy">Security and Privacy</h2><p>We recognise the importance of protecting your personal and financial information.</p><p>All information we obtain about you assists us in servicing you and your account.

Binary Options can have only one of two possible outcomes and allow you to take a simple &quot;Yes or No&quot; approach. Like traditional options, Binary Options are based on an underlying asset such as currencies, commodities, or indices, however one of the most significant differences from traditional options, among others, is that there can be only two outcomes for the option, either the client is paid the return upon the occurrence of the event, or the client loses the investment amount as determined in each option.</p><p>Trading in Binary Options is speculative and involves a high degree of risk that can result in the loss of your entire investment. Therefore, trading in Binary Options is appropriate only for persons that understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal and other risks involved in such transactions. You should be satisfied that Binary Options trading is suitable for you in light of your investment circumstances and attitude towards risk before trading. You should not engage in speculative Binary Options trading unless you understand the basic aspects of such trading and its risks. If you are in any doubt as to whether Binary Option trading is appropriate and suitable for you, please seek independent advice from a investment consulting professional. Binary.com does not provide such advice. It is your responsibility, taking into account your personal circumstances and investment resources, to take particular care and make careful considerations independently, both prior to applying to engage in Binary Options with Binary.com, as well as prior to making any individual order. Where you do not understand the risks involved in applying for a trading account with Binary.com or in making any individual order, you should seek advice and consultation from an independent investment advisor. If you continue to not understand the risks involved in trading in Binary Options, you should not trade at all.</p><p>You are advised that the Binary Options offered by Binary.com are not traded under the rules of any recognised, designated or regulated exchange. Consequently, engaging in Binary Options trading may expose you to substantially greater risks than investments which are so traded.</p><p>You are warned of the following additional risks:</p><p>Derivative investment instruments such as Binary Options and related markets can be highly volatile. The prices of the underlying instrument which a Binary Option refers to may fluctuate rapidly and over wide ranges and may reflect unforeseeable events or changes in conditions, none of which can be controlled by you or Binary.com.</p><p>Binary.com makes efforts that the quoted prices of each underlying asset that a Binary Option refers to will be reasonably related to the actual prices of such asset available in the market. Binary.com makes no warranty, expressed or implied, that the quoted prices represent prevailing market prices.</p><p>Binary.com may have access to information that is not available to you, may have acquired trading positions at prices that are not available to you, and may have interests different from your interests. Binary.com does not undertake any obligation to provide you with market or other information we possess, nor to alter or refrain from our own trading.</p><p>Information of the previous performance of any underlying instrument or asset does not guarantee its current and/or future performance. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.</p><h2 data-anchor="risks-of-investment-products">Risks of Investment Products</h2><p>Investing or trading in Contracts exposes you to the performance of the underlying or reference instrument or asset to which the Binary Contract refers including foreign exchange, indices and commodities each of which have their own features and risks.</p><p><strong>Exchange Rate Risk</strong>: Exchange rates between foreign currencies can change rapidly due to a wide range of economic, political and other conditions, exposing you to risk of exchange rate losses in addition to the inherent risk of loss from trading the underlying investment product. If you deposit funds in a currency to trade Contracts denominated in a different currency, your gains or losses on the underlying investment therefore may be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the currencies.</p><p><strong>Other Risks</strong>: There are other risks that relate to trading investment products and trading foreign currencies that cannot be described in detail in this document. Generally, however, securities, options and currency transactions involve exposure to a combination of the following risk factors: market risk, credit risk, settlement risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and legal risk. For example, there can be serious market disruptions if economic or political or other unforeseen events locally or overseas affect the market. In addition to these types of risk there may be other factors such as accounting and tax treatment issues that you should consider.</p><h2 data-anchor="market-opinions">Market Opinions</h2><p>All opinions, news, research, analysis, prices or other information contained on this website are provided as general market commentary and do not constitute investment advice.

Please be aware of all costs and charges that apply to you because they will affect your profitability.</p><h2 data-anchor="cryptocurrency-risks">Cryptocurrency Risks</h2><p>Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets that are extremely vulnerable to market fluctuations. Trading in cryptocurrencies is a highly speculative investment because prices of cryptocurrencies can go up and down — potentially to a worthless (zero) value. You should not trade in cryptocurrencies unless you fully understand and are aware that trades and /or investments involving cryptocurrencies are complex and high risk in nature and you not only risk incurring significant losses over a short period of time but also risk losing all your invested capital.</p><p>If you lose your cryptocurrencies as a result of exchanges and wallet providers being hacked or becoming insolvent, there is no assurance of a recourse. It is your responsibility to store your cryptocurrencies securely. Binary.com will not accept liability for any loss or damage that arise, directly or indirectly, from theft of your cryptocurrency or insolvency of exchanges and wallet providers that you use.</p><p>All transactions that occur on the blockchain related to cryptocurrency may not be supervised and regulated by financial institutions and government agencies. The absence of an overarching authority overseeing cryptographic transactions means that there is no recourse to banks, payment service providers, or regulators in the event of erroneous or fraudulent transactions. It is your responsibility to check what rules and protections apply in your relevant jurisdiction before investing and / or trading in virtual currency and / or trading on contracts for differences relating to virtual currency. Please be aware of all the risks associated with cryptocurrency trading and seek advice from an independent financial advisor and / or legal advisor if you have any doubts.</p></div></div><div id="risk-mt-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="risk-disclosure-statement">Risk Disclosure Statement</h2><p>This Risk Disclosure Statement is not exhaustive and is not intended to constitute a comprehensive statement of all the risks to which you might be exposed to and does not describe all risks inherent to forex and contracts for differences that exist now or which may arise in the future. Its objective is rather to provide you with information for you to reasonably understand the risks associated with forex and contracts for differences offered by Binary.com in our interest to provide you with the best possible trading experience.</p><h2 data-anchor="forex-and-cfd-high-risk">Forex and contracts for differences are high risk and speculative</h2><p>Forex and contract for differences transactions involve a high degree of risk and are speculative because they allow you to speculate on the short term movements of the price of the underlying financial instruments. You should not enter into forex and/or contracts for differences transactions unless you are able to sustain losses that exceed your deposited funds. It is important for you to understand that in order to realise any value from your open positions, you would have to enter into a corresponding transaction to close your open positions and you may find it difficult or impossible to do so under certain market conditions.</p><h2 data-anchor="execution-model">Execution model and counterparty risk</h2><p>Binary.com offers forex and contracts for differences via the hybrid model, i.e., both dealing on own account (dealing desk) and partially hedging client orders with our liquidity providers (no-dealing desk). Client orders are typically hedged when the total transaction volume exceeds a predefined threshold of risk tolerance level. For both execution models, Binary.com acts as the contractual counterparty to the transactions that you enter into with us, as opposed to entering into a contractual counterparty with a central clearing house as would be the case with exchange traded financial instruments. As such, counterparty risk exists. Counterparty risk refers to the risk of loss for clients resulting from the fact that the counterparty to the forex and/or contracts for differences transaction that you entered into may default on its obligations prior to the final settlement of the transaction&#x27;s cash flow.</p><h2 data-anchor="leverage">Leverage</h2><p>Leverage, in the context of margin trading, refers to the use of margin to increase/amplify the value of a trade. Leverage is expressed as a ratio. A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that you would be able to enter into a trade position that is of 50 times higher than your margin. When you invest in a leveraged product, your profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e., the increased/amplified value of your trade determined based on the leverage ratio you set for your account.</p><p>Leverage can be used to generate returns that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction (your margin). However, investments that have the potential to deliver greater investment returns carry higher levels of risk. This means that if the price movement is against your favour, you will suffer losses that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction (your margin).</p><h2 data-anchor="relationship-between-margin-and-leverage">Relationship between Margin and Leverage</h2><p>The leverage ratio refers to the number of times your margin (the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction) can be &quot;leveraged&quot; to enter into a Transaction. The denominator of the leverage ratio is always 1. A 50:1 leverage is equivalent to a 2% margin requirement (1 divided by 50 = 2%). The leverage ratio that we/you establish will determine the amount of margin required. As leverage is inversely proportional to margin, the lower the leverage you set for your Account, the higher the margin required to be set aside from your account balance (your margin requirement).</p><h2 data-anchor="risk-of-stop-order">Risk of Stop Order</h2><p>The system fills orders on a first-in-first out basis, i.e. based on the sequence of the order received, and this is beyond our control. As a result, you may find it difficult or impossible to close a position at the intended price stipulated in your Stop Order during certain market conditions. The placement of Stop Order by you, though useful as a risk management tool, will not necessarily limit your losses to your intended amounts, in the event of highly volatile trading conditions, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders and there is uncertainty about your possible exit price. In short, a Stop Order is not guaranteed because it cannot operate whatever the market circumstances are.</p><h2 data-anchor="regular-monitoring">Regular monitoring of open positions</h2><p>Trading forex and contracts for differences carries a high level of risk and Binary.com does not monitor the open positions of your account on your behalf. It is your responsibility to monitor your Open Positions and understand the exposure of your Open Positions whilst ensuring that your exposure commensurate with your risk appetite. Due to the cost associated with overnight open positions, you should consider investing in the market of the instrument in which you ordinarily transact in instead of investing in a CFD.</p><h2 data-anchor="risk-of-slippage">Risk of slippage</h2><p>Whilst we endeavor to open or close the Transaction to which your orders relate at the requested price, acting in accordance with our duty of best execution, there are times when, due to an increase in volatility or volume, orders may be subject to slippage. The difference between the order price and execution price when orders are filled is known as slippage. This means that your order is not filled at the exact intended quoted price when you placed your order. Slippage is usually seen during periods of extremely high or low volatility and generally occurs during fundamental news releases or periods of limited liquidity. Slippages can result in either a positive slippage (more favourable to you) or a negative slippage (less favourable to you).</p><h2 data-anchor="external-forces">External forces</h2><p>Your forex and contracts for differences transactions with Binary.com are linked to an underlying financial instrument and you will be exposed to price, currency exchange, interest rate or other volatility of the market to which your financial instrument is related to, especially if the market is of a jurisdiction that is foreign to you. Forex and contracts for differences trading over the internet via an electronic trading platform is subject to data latency risk which may result in delays in order execution.</p><h2 data-anchor="risk-of-cryptocurrency-cfd">Risk of cryptocurrency contracts for differences</h2><p>Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets that are extremely vulnerable to market fluctuations. Trading cryptocurrency contracts for differences is highly speculative investment because prices of cryptocurrencies can go up and down — potentially to a worthless (zero) value. Investing in cryptocurrency contracts for differences through leveraged accounts amplifies this underlying volatility risk, making the change in prices even more significant. When you invest in a leveraged contract for differences related to cryptocurrencies, your profit or loss is based on the leveraged ratio you set for your account. If the price movement is in your favour, returns generated are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction. However, if the price movement is against your favour, you will suffer losses that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction. You should not trade in cryptocurrencies unless you fully understand and are aware that trades and / or investments involving cryptocurrencies are complex and high risk in nature and you not only risk incurring significant losses over a short period of time but also risk losing all your invested capital.</p></div></div><div id="order-execution-binary-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="summary-order-execution-policy">Summary of the order execution policy</h2><p>The Company has a general duty to conduct its business with the client honestly, fairly, and professionally and to act in the client&#x27;s best interests when opening and closing binary options trades with the client.</p><p>More specifically, when the Company enters into a binary option trade with the client (each, a &quot;Contract&quot;), the Company has a duty to provide the client with &#x27;best execution&#x27;. Best execution means that the Company must take reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result for the client when executing a client order. This document provides a summary of the Company&#x27;s best execution policy.</p><p>The client should note that the Company&#x27;s duty to provide the client with best execution does not apply to any gaming products that the client places with the Company, when there is no underlying financial market.</p><p>This policy applies to clients classified as retail or professional. Clients classified as eligible counterparties are outside the scope of this policy.</p><h2 data-anchor="general">General</h2><p>The Company&#x27;s order execution policy comprises a set of procedures that are designed to obtain the best possible execution result for the client, subject to and taking into account:</p><ul><li>(a) the nature of the client&#x27;s Contracts;</li><li>(b) the priorities that the client has identified for the Company in relation to entering into those Contracts; and</li><li>(c) the practices relating to the market in question, with the aim of producing a result that provides, in the Company&#x27;s view, the best balance across a range of sometimes conflicting factors.</li></ul><p>The Company&#x27;s policy cannot provide a guarantee, however, that when entering into Contracts with the client, the price will always be better than one that is or might have been available elsewhere.</p><h2 data-anchor="order-execution">Order execution</h2><p>The Company is licensed to deal in derivatives on its own account. Client orders will be executed by the Company and the Company will always be the client&#x27;s sole execution venue for all of the trades a client makes in binary options. This means that the Company will always act as the client&#x27;s counterparty, wherein it takes the other side of the client&#x27;s trade. The clients should be aware that they are exposed to higher risks as all binary options contracts are traded on the over-the-counter (OTC) markets, as opposed to regulated exchanges. This section of the policy will outline how the Company intends to comply with its best execution obligations.</p><h2 data-anchor="classes-of-instruments">Classes of instruments</h2><p>The Company offers binary options through its online interactive platform.</p><p>A binary option is a contract in which one party undertakes to pay the other party a specified amount if the value of a given asset changes in a specific direction within a predetermined period. The three major underlying asset classes for binary options offered by the Company are:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>Forex;</li><li>indices; and</li><li>commodities.</li></ul><h2 data-anchor="best-execution-factors">Best execution factors</h2><p>In relation to Contracts that the client enters into with the Company, the Company acts as principal and not as agent on the client&#x27;s behalf; therefore, the Company acts as the sole execution venue for the execution of the client&#x27;s Contracts.</p><p>The Company will mainly ensure best execution for the client by giving due consideration to the market price when calculating the Company&#x27;s bid/offer price for the underlying reference product to which the client&#x27;s Contract relates. In order to ascertain the market price, the Company has access to a number of different data sources, which provide the Company with an objective view of the bids and offers available to arms&#x27; length traders.</p><p>In the case of some Contracts, there may be no functioning or open market or exchange on which the reference product is traded at the time of the client order. In such cases, the Company sets out to determine a fair underlying price based on a number of factors, such as price movements on associated markets and other market influences and information about the client order.</p><p>The Company is required to take a number of factors into account when considering how to give the client best execution, specifically:</p><ul><li>(a) Price and cost<p>The Company has internally set appropriate controls and monitoring to verify that its aggregate return on the various underlying options and durations is equal to its commission charge of 3 - 5%. Proper back-testing is conducted on a quarterly basis to certify that the Company&#x27;s return does not exceed this set mark-up and hence ascertain continued fair prices to the clientele, whilst mitigating the Company&#x27;s conflicts of interest.</p></li><li>(b) Speed<p>Due to the online nature of the business and instruments, there is a small delay between an order being entered and the same order being executed on the server. Any significant delay can have negative impacts on clients; therefore, the Company monitors the latency between the entering and execution of client orders. Should this delay exceed the established threshold, then the system administrators will be notified so that they can investigate any possible issue.</p></li><li>(c) Likelihood of execution<p>The Company strives to ensure that all the orders placed are executed; however, this is not always possible due to material difficulty or unusual circumstances. In any instance that the Company is aware of any material difficulty relevant to the proper execution of an order, it promptly informs the client of the issue.</p></li><li>(d) Likelihood of settlement<p>During volatile markets, the Company&#x27;s trading platform runs across a high number of concurrent online users, high volumes of client orders, and a high number of imported price ticks.  As part of the Company&#x27;s best execution delivery to its clients, the Company ensures that its platform runs smoothly under such stressed conditions and takes all reasonable steps to safeguard the continuity and regularity in the performance of investment activities.</p></li><li>(e) Size and nature<p>Orders will generally be auto-accepted if they do not take the Company over exposure limits and the client has enough remaining balance in their account. With every contract purchased, the Company has systems in place that automatically carry out a large exposure check, and, in case the new total exposure result is greater than or equal to 25% of the eligible capital, the contract cannot be sold to the client.</p></li></ul><h2 data-anchor="specific-instructions">Specific instructions</h2><p>When the client gives the Company specific instructions, including (a) specifying the price of a Contract with the Company or (b) specifying the price at which a Contract is to be closed, then those instructions take precedence over other aspects of the Company&#x27;s policy.</p><h2 data-anchor="no-fiduciary-duty">No fiduciary duty</h2><p>The Company&#x27;s commitment to provide the client with &#x27;best execution&#x27; does not mean that the Company owes the client any fiduciary responsibilities over and above the specific regulatory obligations placed upon the Company or as may be otherwise contracted between the Company and the client.</p><h2 data-anchor="monitoring-and-review">Monitoring and review of this policy</h2><p>The Company will monitor the effectiveness of its order execution arrangements and order execution policy. The Company will assess from time to time whether the venues relied upon by the Company in pricing its Contracts on the client&#x27;s behalf allow the Company to achieve best execution on a consistent basis or whether the Company needs to make changes to its execution arrangements. The Company will also review its order execution arrangements and order execution policy in respect of material changes, either regarding one of the Company&#x27;s chosen pricing venues or what might otherwise affect the Company&#x27;s ability to continue to achieve best execution. Should there be any material changes to the Company&#x27;s order execution arrangements or order execution policy, the Company will notify the client.</p></div></div><div id="order-execution-mt-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="order-execution-policy">Order execution policy</h2><h2 data-anchor="introduction">A.

Client instructions</h2><p>When the Company accepts an order from the client to open or close a transaction, or any other specific instructions in relation to the client&#x27;s order, the Company will endeavour to follow the client&#x27;s instructions as far as reasonably possible, acting in accordance with the Company&#x27;s duty of best execution in accordance with the client&#x27;s instructions. These specific instructions include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>a) the venue at which the client&#x27;s order will be executed;</li><li>b) the price at which the client&#x27;s order will be executed;</li><li>c) the time at which the client&#x27;s order will be executed; and</li><li>d) the timeframe or duration of the contract as defined by the client&#x27;s order execution.</li></ul><p>Where a particular venue has been specified in the client&#x27;s instructions with respect to the execution of an order, the Company will not be responsible for the venue selection.</p><p>Where a particular time or timeframe has been specified in a client&#x27;s instructions with respect to the execution of an order, regardless of the price available, the Company will endeavour to execute the order at the specified time or over the specified timeframe in the best possible manner after taking all sufficient steps. However, the Company will not be responsible for any consequences related to pricing that are resulted from the time or timeframe of the execution.</p><p>Aspects of a client order not affected by specific instructions are subject to the application of Binary.com&#x27;s order execution policy. In the absence of specific instructions from clients, the Company will exercise its own discretion in determining the factors that are required to be taken into account for the purpose of providing clients with best execution, paying regard to the execution criteria listed below:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>the characteristics of the client</li><li>the characteristics of the order</li><li>the characteristics of financial instruments that are the subject of that order</li><li>the characteristics of the execution venues to which that order can be directed</li></ul><h2 data-anchor="best-execution-obligation">E. Best execution obligation</h2><p>Binary.com owes the client a duty of best execution when executing orders on the client&#x27;s behalf, i.e. when the client places a legitimate reliance on the Company to safeguard the client&#x27;s interest in relation to the execution of the client&#x27;s order.</p><p>In executing orders on the client&#x27;s behalf, Binary.com takes into consideration the following to achieve the best possible result for the client:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>price - the price at which the transaction in relation to the client&#x27;s order is executed</li><li>costs - the costs of executing client order, predominantly comprising of spread, i.e. the difference between the Company&#x27;s bid and the Company&#x27;s offer price</li><li>speed - the speed at which client order can be executed</li><li>likelihood of execution and settlement - the depth of liquidity of the market to which client order is related</li><li>size - the size of client order determined by the volume (number of lots)</li><li>any other consideration relevant to the execution of the transaction</li></ul><p>The factors listed above are not listed in order of priority. Ordinarily, price will merit a high relative importance in obtaining the best possible result for the client. However, the relative importance of the listed factors above may change in accordance with:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>the specific instructions that the Company receives from the client;</li><li>the market conditions of the financial instruments that client orders are related to, which includes the need for timely execution, availability of price improvement, liquidity of the market, size of client order, and the potential impact on total consideration.</li></ul><p>The Company&#x27;s determination of the relative importance of the execution factors may differ from the client&#x27;s during certain circumstances, acting in the client&#x27;s interest in accordance with the Company&#x27;s obligation of best execution.</p><h2 data-anchor="execution-venues">F. Execution venues</h2><p>Binary.com offers Forex and contracts for differences via the hybrid model, i.e. dealing on own account (dealing desk – B-book) or partially hedging client orders with the Company&#x27;s liquidity providers (no-dealing desk – A-book).</p><p>When the Company deals on own account (dealing desk), the Company acts as principal and not as an agent on the client&#x27;s behalf and the Company therefore acts as the execution venue.</p><p>Whilst the Company acts as principal in respect of the client&#x27;s orders, the Company also assesses the execution venues that the Company uses and upon which the Company places significant reliance to provide the best possible result for the execution of the client&#x27;s orders. These venues typically consist of third-party investment firms, brokers, and/or liquidity providers.</p><p>Binary.com assesses the choice of external execution venues regularly (at least once a year) with the intention of achieving a better result for the client based on the Company&#x27;s best execution obligation.</p><p>When executing client orders using the A-book model, the Company directs the client&#x27;s trade to one of its liquidity providers, namely:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>GBE Brokers;</li><li>Invast Financial Services Pty Ltd;</li><li>FXOpen; or</li><li>CFH Clearing Limited.</li></ul><h2 data-anchor="order-handling">G. Order handling</h2><p>All client orders are processed on a first in, first out basis without any manual intervention. When executing client order, Binary.com will seek to fill client order transaction as promptly as possible at the instructed price (or at a better price, if available). Exposure limits are established based on internal governance arrangements and risk management framework, which both commensurate with the size, nature, complexity, and risk profile of the Company&#x27;s activities. These exposure limits are used as benchmarks to distinguish orders that are auto-accepted from orders that will be worked in the market with fill level passed on to the client.</p><h2 data-anchor="monitoring-and-review">H. Monitoring and review</h2><p>The Company will monitor the effectiveness of the Company&#x27;s order execution arrangements and order execution policy. The Company will assess from time to time whether the venues relied upon by the Company in pricing the Company&#x27;s contracts on the client&#x27;s behalf allow the Company to achieve best execution on a consistent basis or whether the Company needs to make changes to the Company&#x27;s execution arrangements. The Company will also review the Company&#x27;s order execution arrangements and order execution policy in respect of material changes either in respect of one of the Company&#x27;s chosen pricing venues or what otherwise affects the Company&#x27;s ability to continue to achieve best execution. Should there be any material changes to the Company&#x27;s order execution arrangements or order execution policy, the Company will notify the client.</p><h2 data-anchor="appendix-product-specific-policies">Appendix - Product specific policies</h2><h2 data-anchor="spot-fx">A. Spot FX</h2><p>For features and trading illustration of Spot FX offered by Binary.com, refer to the Product disclosure statement. This policy is an appendix to, and should be read in conjunction with, the overarching Binary.com&#x27;s order execution policy.</p><p>Binary.com provides the client with best execution by utilising a smart aggregation method when managing incoming orders. The smart aggregation method works by:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>consolidating liquidity from several providers into a single stream of blended feed; and</li><li>intelligently routing incoming orders to different types of execution modes based on configurations and algorithms established using best execution factors.</li></ul><p>By default, the intelligent order routing system ensures that the top of the book is always comprised of the best bid and offer rates quoted by the competing liquidity providers. However, during times of market illiquidity, this may change with likelihood of execution being the primary execution factor.</p><p>Depending on the level of risk that the Company is exposed to while acting as the client&#x27;s counterparty, the Company acts largely in a principal capacity of the client&#x27;s trades. As such, the execution venue will usually be Binary.com. However, the Company may transmit the client&#x27;s order to third-party liquidity providers, in which case the Company will determine the execution venue on the basis described above.</p><p>The execution venues are assessed, on a regular basis, as to whether they provide for the best possible result for the clients.</p></div></div><div id="payment-agents-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="payment-agents-terms-and-conditions">Payment Agents Terms and Conditions</h2><h2 data-anchor="scope-of-agreement">A.
